This project was made in 2 weeks by me (uberti_l) and my partner , trogno_n
Shoutout to him ;)

The goal of this project was to find the exit of different types of mazes (imperfect and perfect) using 3 different algorithms
In order :

  >Deep First Search (in the folder "profondeur")
  
  >Breadth First Search (in the folder "largeur")
  
  >A* (in the folder "astar")

    Usage : ./generateur WIDTH HEIGHT [imperfect,perfect]
    
    Usage for the solvers : ./solver maze.txt
    
    To build the project : make re
