#	Raytracer 2
This project was done by me (uberti_l), rahil_f and grella_f (but we all know who did everything...)

This raytracer is entirely made using C language and the liblapin 1.9 by Jason Brillante (Epitech) thus liblapin 1.9 is required to launch this raytracer (provided in the lib dir)


You can load .obj file so feel free to use the one you like or the given ones !

Type this to build the program : make re

     Usage : ./raytracer .obj_file [OPTIONS]
     Options : --width=nb      Select your own width (Default is 1920)
	           --height=nb     Select your own height (Default is 1080)
	           --fullscreen=nb Enable(1) or disable(0) fullscreen mode (Default is 0)
	           --help	       Display the help page

Feel free to give any feedback on how to improve it (no light implementation because of i lacked time) !!
