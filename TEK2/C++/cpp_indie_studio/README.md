# Indie Studio (Hyper Sprint)

## Description

Hyper Sprint is the remake of a famous game called Hyper Sprint too. But we did it our way, which is basically a basic copy of Mario Kart working on Linux / MacOS / Windows.
The whole project was built using the Irrlicht game engine and modern C++.
Very limited time to develop the game but we are pretty happy with the outcoming result.

This game can be played with up to 4 players and 2 using controllers on the same computer !

If I remember correctly :
- Player 1 is ZQSD
- Player 2 is UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT
- Player 3 is IJKL
- Player 4 has to play with a Xbox One controller

## Prerequisites
- make and g++ installed
- Irrlicht (see ```Release``` and ```lib``` directories for all the .dll and .a files)

## Installation
### Windows
Use the provided installer in the ```ÃŒnstaller``` folder

**OR**

Compile the project in the ```Windows``` directory using Visual Studio

### MacOS / Linux
Use the makefile and hope nothing breaks as it has many dependencies
```make re && make install```
